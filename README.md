# Hi there, I'm Owamagbe David ðŸ‘‹
I am a final year student at the University of Plymouth, studying Computer Science (Cyber Security). My passion lies in Cyber Security and Web development, and I enjoy exploring these fields through personal projects and academic research.

### ðŸ”­ Current Projects
I am currently working on several projects related to Cyber Security and Web development. These projects include:

- A malware detection tool for Windows portable executable files using machine learning techniques.
- A web application for secure file sharing using cryptographic algorithms.
- A website for a farm business to shop online and manage sales using a full-stack web development approach.
### ðŸŒ± Learning
As a lifelong learner, I am always seeking to expand my knowledge and skills. Some of the technologies and tools that I am currently learning or planning to learn include:

- Python frameworks such as Flask and Django for web development.
- Cloud computing platforms such as AWS and Azure for scalability and reliability.
- Tools and techniques for penetration testing and vulnerability assessments.
