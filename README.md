A website for managing personal finances using a full-stack web development approach.
### ðŸŒ± Learning
As a lifelong learner, I am always seeking to expand my knowledge and skills. Some of the technologies and tools that I am currently learning or planning to learn include:

Python frameworks such as Flask and Django for web development.
Cloud computing platforms such as AWS and Azure for scalability and reliability.
Tools and techniques for penetration testing and vulnerability assessments.
